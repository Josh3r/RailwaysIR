new process for converting pig or cast iron into wrought iron using coal in. This changes rendered the production of iron independent of wood from the forests and with the lag of iron production relieved, British iron production multiplied more than tenfold from a low point of fewer than 25000 tons per year. This led to an increase in railway production from 1788 to the 19th century with railroad construction booming another fortyfold. (McClellan III & Dorn, 2006, 282)\r\n\r\nSince 1700, mining districts have been using wooden rails for the passage of trucks. The opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway in 1830 however, was equipped with a new multitubular boiler, which immensely increased the volume of steam and as a direct result, increased the speed of the train too. It was able to convey carriages laden with passengers at a speed of 15 miles per hour or more, which far exceeded expectations in its earlier trials. The success of this railway was what sparked the development of many other railways in Britain.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src='https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/styles/fullsize/public/images/horse-towing-coal.jpg?itok=3PDvD0N7' style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n        <text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Figure 1.

Using this concept, it was proposed to construct a public railway between Stockton and Darington which completed in 1825. It turned out to be successful as a goods line and unsuccessful in passenger line due to its slowness.

The Dutch engineers were specialised in building bridges and other water-related infrastructure, knowing nothing about engines. Due to the inadequacies of the Dutch engineers, there was much dependence on foreign technology. Technologies utilised by the Dutch during the railway boom include:\r\n        \r\n        <ol><li>Ground Reinforcement: \r\n        \r\nDue to the waterlogged ecotype of the Netherlands, much of the road work comprised of soft unstable clay, highly unstable for building rail tracks on. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 10) Thus, the Dutch had to infuse various materials into the ground to ensure stability.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nBridge Building\r\nThe many water bodies present in the Netherlands had to be crossed by these railways, however, these water bodies were also important trade routes (e.g: Rotterdam Port to central Netherlands) Thus, a Dutch engineer Frederick Willem Conrad Jr invented a genius solution known as the crane bridge. This unique design facilitated both railway and water transport to coexist in the same location (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 9)\r\n</li>\r\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/opyWD22.png'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Figure 3:The Moerdijk bridge in the 1890s. in Europe.</em></text>\r\n<li>The Engine:\r\nThe actual engines themselves were imported from Northumberland, in the North East of England. In the later years (the 1850s) however, the Dutch would invent their own steam engine, which ran on coal as opposed to the British steam engine which ran on coal. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 12) Interestingly, locomotives used in the 2 major railways: Rhenish and Holland railway, were different.\r\nThe Rhenish railway displayed a large extent of British influence, with most of its’ locomotives imported from Sharp, Steward and Company based in Manchester, England.\r\nThe Holland railway comprised largely of German trains designed by Borsig of Berlin, due to the low cost and swift delivery of these trains. This was because German stakeholders desired to promote German industry over their rival England. \r\nThe takeover by Dutch railways began in 1876, when Gerrit Middelberg, a Dutch railway engineer invented his famous ‘Runners’. Middelberg was a prolific innovator, constantly searching for patents and new methods. These ‘Runners’ were incredibly impressive for its time, 562 horsepower, beating the formerly unrivalled 553 horsepower of the German Eisenbahn. The engines used integrated compound steam modules, greatly decreasing coal consumption. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 29)\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div label=\"Development of Railways\">\r\n      <p style={{fontSize:'30px'}}>\r\n          <b>Britain</b>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        <b>Investments:</b></p>\r\n<p>The railway boom occurred in the 1830s and 1840s, where the development of railway skyrocketed. There were speculations about how the returns for investing in railways were very high. This caused many people, from professional investors to small traders, to put their savings into the railway industry. (Mitchell, 1964, pg 332) This large inflow of investment allowed the development of railways to continue at lightning speed. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nMore Efficient Mode of Transport:\r\n</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis new means of transport reduced transportation cost drastically for both passengers and goods in comparison to road and canal. An excerpt from a study done by Baxter stated that the journey from Doncaster to London by mail on a coach takes 20 hours covering 156 miles and cost 5 pounds inside and 3 pounds outside. The railway takes 4 hours covering the same distance and cost 27 shillings for first-class and 21 shillings for second class. (1 pound = 20 shillings). Now due to the competition, the fare for coaching is slightly more than one-quarter of the previous amount however the travelling time remains. It also had the same effect for canal traffic. \r\n\r\nAs canals were the main mode of transportation before railways superseded it, during railway development, removal of some canals was necessary. As railways became the better mode of transport, it terms of efficiency, canal companies were bought over by railway companies either to close them down or to build railway lines on the canals.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/uRg8O29.jpg'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Figures showing the efficiency of railway as a mode of transport.</em></text>\r\n<p><b>\r\nMillitary Advantage:\r\n</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe governor-general of India in 1853, Lord Dalhousie mentioned how the development of the railway was also supported by military motives to obtain intelligence within days compared to months. (Headrick, 1981, 182) From the involvement of railways in The Great War, this suggests how Britain probably also had a similar plan, which is some -thing that would have contributed to the spread of railway development. \r\n</p>\r\n        <p style={{fontSize:'30px'}}>\r\n          <b>Netherlands</b>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>\r\nPre-railways:\r\n</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Netherlands was largely agricultural and mercantilist. The central of Netherlands was well connected to it’s incredibly important economic ports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam, located along the West Coast of the country. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nWhat caused the railways to be built?\r\n</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe 2 major rivers connecting Netherland’s port to the German industrial sites were the Rhine and Waal river. These 2 great rivers became increasingly congested during the time period. This led to a need for a faster and uncongested alternative, which was the building of railways. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 6) \r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nSuccess of the Railways:\r\n</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe very first railway campaign was spearheaded by Dutch businessman and officer, William Brade. Brade’s focus on practicality and only utilising tried and tested technologies led to the success of the first Dutch railway plan. He also founded the nation’s first railway company: HSM. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 7) The building of the railways were greatly aided from funds from the Dutch East Indies company, from the revenue generated from their colonies’ cash crops. Growth of cash crops such as sugar, coffee and tea were rapid, in return, yielding high revenue for the Dutch East Indies company. (Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 6) \r\nThe first railway was opened September 20th 1839. It was incredibly successful, immediately sparking more railway projects, including the Haarlem-Leiden line (North to South Netherlands). Much like the land rights issues faced in Britain, the railway plans faced stringent land-rights laws, allowing land owners of potential railway-land to demand exorbitant amounts, slowing down the railway implementation.(Augustus J. Veenendaal, 1995, pg 11) The rapid extension of railway lines led to a boom in demand for engines. The domestic Dutch industry seized the opportunity, kickstarting their very own locally-built trains. \r\n</p>\r\n<img src='https://i.imgur.com/m3p1bbK.png'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Photograph of Holland Railway, 1865(Collection NVBS)</em></text>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n      <div label=\"Effects of Railways\">\r\n      <p style={{fontSize:'30px'}}>\r\n          <b>Britain</b>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Cost of Transport and Canal Companies:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\nBefore railways, the main mode of transport was through canals.The competition railways brought caused the prices of transportation by canals to slash to point where almost no profit could be made.(Mitchell, 1964, pg 318) Ultimately, many of these canal companies were either bought over by railway companies.This enabled transport to be a lot more efficient and cost effective.\r\n\r\nAs Britain is a manufacturing and commercial country, every extension of the railway system in foreign countries benefits them because every new route that opens up introduces fresh markets and reduces the cost of transporting their manufactured products. (Baxter, 1866, 594)\r\n\r\nEven though the railroad was meant to facilitate the ease of transportation for either goods or people, it affected older modes of transportation such as the use of either roads or canals. Therefore, the railway movement encountered heavy resistance from people who had a vested interest in both roads and canals. An excerpt from the “Life of Robert Stephanson”, an engineer of the London and Birmingham line mentioned that the aristocracy, journalists and people from humbler classes viewed the railway system in a negative light with different underlying reasons. (Baxter, 1866, 551) \r\n\r\nDespite the vehement opposition of the railway system, it still managed to push through legislation and instead of the difficulty of Parliament passing any bills, multiple companies now petitioned for the rights to build railways in different locations. This resulted in multiple companies building railways in similar locations. This prompted a loss of confidence in the public as the prices of shares plummeted and the dissolution of companies brought about the abandonment of railways around the country, thus affecting the progress of the railway industry from a period of 1845 to 1848.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>Railway Towns and Employment:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Railways are used as a means of spreading businesses into inland towns. People who supported the railway development usually gained benefits from it by selling their goods to the people and also securing a more suitable means of getting raw materials. (Headrick, 1981, 182) For example, railway towns such as Crewe and Swindon owe their development to the railway industry. (Turton, 1961, pg 97) During the development of railways, there was a demand for raw materials and labour. Hence, the population living near areas where railways were being built, looked to the railway industry for employment. The availability of manpower was due to the underemployment and also the migration of population from Ireland. (Mitchell, 1964, pg 322)\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src='https://i.imgur.com/FfogtsS.png'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>We can see that railway development brought about significant employment opportunities.</em></text>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Because the work at railway construction areas were highly labour intensive, most of the workers were male. However, the location of railways also brought about the opening of clothing factories. Since the workload in such factories were ‘lighter’, most of the workers employed were from the female population. (Turton, 1961, pg 102)  These clothing factories even went on to be the ones who made the uniforms of railway workers. Hence, these examples show how railway development went on to create many opportunities in its surrounding area.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Demand of Wood and Iron:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        As mentioned previously, wooden rails were what was previously used before iron. Hence, the change in usage of wood to iron caused the demand for wood to fall greatly. However, because wood was imported into Britain, this effect was felt mostly overseas. (Mitchell, 1964, pg 328)\r\n\r\nRailway development led to the increase in demand for iron in 1835. The output of pig iron increased by half a million tons from 1832 to 1835. (Mitchell, 1964, pg 326) However, because the railway industry was such a big part of the demand for iron, the decrease in demand of railway in 1841 to 1843 also negatively affected the iron industry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><b>Government Intervention and Safety:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        The railways were under state control during World War 1. Small railway companies combined to form the Big Four: Great Western Railway (GWR), London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), Southern Railway (SR). this was the result of the 1921 Railways Act. \r\nBefore the railway boom, railways were mostly owned by small private companies, and the government had little involvement. However, the Government stepped in with concerns for safety and implemented the \"Act for Regulating Railways\" in 1840, which empowered the Board of Trade to appoint railway inspectors.\r\n</p> \r\n        <p style={{fontSize:'30px'}}>\r\n          <b>Netherlands</b>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><b>Connectivity:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        For the first time since the 17th century, Dutch cities were able to expand beyond the city walls. Prior to the 1850s, railways in the Netherlands only connected the 2 main cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam to each other and to the neighbouring German industrial zones. (Dena Kasraian, Kees Maat and Bert van Wee, 2016, pg 159) Following the 1850s, various cities and towns within the country had railway lines built, connecting them to other parts of the country.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src='https://i.imgur.com/Xuuk7Yf.png'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Geographical development of railways from mid 1800s to late 1800s(Journal of Transport and Land Use, Vol. 9, No. 1 (2016)</em></text>\r\n\r\n      <p><b>Urbanisation:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        Built Up Areas (BUAs) surrounding the major railway stations were products of a process called urban sprawl, which is defined as physical expansion of urban infrastructure and buildings surrounding a local urban centre. These BUAs resulted in proximal villages and towns of railway stations rapidly modernising(Dena Kasraian, Kees Maat and Bert van Wee, 2016, pg 161)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src='https://i.imgur.com/0kUv6yZ.png'style={{display:'block',margin:'0 auto'}}></img>\r\n<text style={{display:'flex',justifyContent:'center'}}><em>Urban sprawl of areas surrounding major railway stations(Journal of Transport and Land Use, Vol. 9, No. 1 (2016)</em></text>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Social:</b></p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        One major benefit of the rapid railway development was the exponential increase in employment from the 1840s to the early 1900s.\r\nThat being said, the large influx of workers to railway stations caused problems for the local government. Workers would commonly cause social disheval during idle times of bad weather or at the end of the work day - under the influence of alcohol.\r\nSeveral incidents include: Local administration in Ede had to call the army in to restore order in 1842 and a similar situation in Renswoude, whereby the army was called in again to restore order in 1843.

Veenendaal, 1995, pg 13)\r\n      </p>\r\n         \r\n      </div>\r\n      <div label=\"Conclusion\">\r\n        <p>For both Britain and the Netherlands, the development of railways was to reduce travelling time throughout the country, making them more connected within themselves. The railway boom for Britain happened around the 1840s, while it happened for the Netherlands 10 to 20 years later. This was probably due to the convenience Netherlands had by travelling on boats through the many canals in their country. It was only when they realised the canals were getting too congested that they started to shift their mode of transport to railways. The impacts railway development brought about in terms of employment and economic growth were almost equally as significant in both countries</p>\r\n        <p>Railways contributed to the spread of knowledge, arts and people. The development of railways has come a long way from using wooden rails and horses to cast iron and coal. It brought about a new method of transportation for passengers as well as goods. Railways did not only revolutionise the transportation industry but it also affected other industries such as iron, coal and engineering. How the labour force was distributed and migration patterns were also brought about by the railway boom. Needless to say, railways also impacted how the economy was and turned out to be. The tremendous role railways have played in their countries and even throughout the world can still be experienced today, which is what makes studying and understanding its history so relevant and interesting.</p>\r\n        <p>Railroads are more than tracks and trains; they are a whole new way of life, the forerunners of a new civilisation.
